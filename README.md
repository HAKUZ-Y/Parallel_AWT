Example:
```
./awt_baseline -i ../dataset/grayscale/easy_2048.txt -l 1
./awt_baseline -i ../dataset/grayscale/medium_8192.txt -l 13 -t 3
```

TODO:
- Is the algo itself correct?
- test files are too large for harder test
- computation times kinds of too fast 0.1 for easy, 1.8 for medium, 3.0 for large
- Should we batch images?
