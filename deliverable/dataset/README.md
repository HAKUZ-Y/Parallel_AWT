# Dataset


## grayscale: 
It includes the test input, becasue the size of medium and hard tests are too large, we only included the easy one.


## reconstructed:
This is where the reconstructed grayscale image will be saved.

## transformed:
This is where the transformed grayscale image will be saved.

## Scripts:
- grayscale_to_image.py: convert grayscale txt to human readable image and evaluate transformed, reconstructed image.
- image_to_grayscale.py: convert image to test dataset.
